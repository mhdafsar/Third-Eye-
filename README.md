# Third_Eye

The Third Eye Project is all about an assistive technology designed to aid visually impaired individuals in navigating their surroundings.

This project utilizes computer vision, machine learning, and sensor technologies to detect objects, obstacles, and important landmarks, providing real-time feedback to the user through audio cues.

The aim of this project is to enhance the independence and safety of visually impaired people, allowing them to explore their environment with greater confidence.

The Project mainly consists of three modules,

* FACE RECOGNITION
* OBJECT DETECTION
* TEXT RECOGNITION
